# React datepicker

Yet another react datepicker.

So WIP, very not needed, much salvage.

## TODO

- use scss modules
- fix "any" types with events
- fix moment type errors
- icon coloring is broken on pre-chrome Edge
- maybe inline range util

----

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), bla bla bla bla. We still have `npm start` and  `npm run build` I guess. Praise the sun. And react.
